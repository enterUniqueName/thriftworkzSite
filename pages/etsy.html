  <h3>Selling on Etsy</h3>

  <h4>Pros</h4>
  <ul>

      <li><b>Large Market Audience</b>
          <ul>
              <li>
                Etsy has more than 35 million active buyers and analysts project their revenue will continue to grow in 2020.
                <br>
                Buyers come to Etsy looking for specific handmade items, so you already have a built-in audience that’s looking for your products.
                <br>
                Listing your products on Etsy will allow you to potentially get sales from organic search traffic on the Etsy homepage, which can complement your outside marketing efforts.
              </li>
              <li>
                Depop does have a 10% comission fee that is applied to all sales.
              </li>
          </ul>
      </li>
      
      <li><b>Built-in Analytics</b>
          <ul>
              <li>
                Etsy offers their users all all of their sales analytics on their seller dashboards so that they can track their all time sales and how much money they have made.
                <br>
                Other sites such as Ebay charge their users a monthly fee to retain access to their selling analytics.
              </li>
          </ul>
      </li>

      <li><b>Freedom to be Yourself</b>
          <ul>
              <li>
                The reason Etsy has so much sales traffic is because they allow sellers to be themselves.
                <br>
                Etsy continues to encourage sellers to create and sell handmade items in their stores because it makes them unique in the vast array of ecommerce sites.
              </li>
          </ul>
      </li>

  </ul>


  <h4>Cons</h4>
  <ul>

      <li><b>Replicas/Copycats</b>
          <ul>
              <li>
                When Etsy first started, it would be highly unlikely if someone was selling the same things as you.
                <br>
                Nowadays, there are sellers on Etsy who will find your product, re-create it, and then undercut your price so that they now control your niche market.
                <br>
                This isn't a problem to those who know that their product cannot be re-created the same way, however; this is an issue for those who create smaller, less expensive items that are easily replicated.
              </li>
          </ul>
      </li>

      <li><b>Fees</b>
          <ul>
              <li>
                Any platform you use to sell on has fees, but Etsy takes the cake when it comes to making it as confusing as possible.
                <br>
                You are charged a fee of $0.20 for each item that you list for sale, you will also be charged a transaction fee of 5% of the price you display for each listing plus the amount you charge for shipping and gift wrapping, as well as a transaction processing fee of 3% per sold listing.
                <br>
                These are only the fees that are charged by Etsy, if you wish to use Paypal as your payment processor, you will also pay them a 2% processing fee ontop of everything else.
              </li>
