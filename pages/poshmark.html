  <h4>Cons</h4>
  <ul>

      <li><b>Selling Fees</b>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Selling fees on Poshmark are the highest amongst all of the eccomerce sites. Poshmark charges a <strong>20%</strong> final selling fee for every itemt that sell.
            </li>
            <li>
              This means that if you sell a <strong>$200</strong> coat, Poshmark will takes <strong>$40</strong> off the top. This is 8% more than what Ebay asks for.
            </li>
          </ul>
      </li>

      <li><b>Poshmark App</b>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Poshmark has the most unappealing app amongst all of the commerce platforms.
              <br>
              The app has a horrible layout that makes it very confusing to find what you are looking for.
              <br>
              The dark burgandy and egg shell white color scheme on the app makes it displeasing to the eye.
            </li>
          </ul>
      </li>

      <li><b>The Need to be Active</b>
          <ul>
            <li>
              In order to make continuous sales on Poshmark, sellers must remain active on the site.
              <br>
              This includes liking other sellers items, sharing other sellers items, sending offers to potential buyers, and creating styles out of multiple litings.
            </li>
            <li>
              This makes the need to create sales unbelievably tedious and ultimately turns your sidehustle into a second job.
            </li>
          </ul>
      </li>

      <li><b>Privacy</b>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Many users have reported that they have been harassed through their listings by some less than reputable buyers.
              <br>
              Users are able to upload a profile picture on their page and this often brings unwanted attention to their selling page.
            </li>
          </ul>
