  <h2>What is Mercari? </h2>
  
  <p>Mercari emmerged into the eccomerce scene in 2013 and was met with little to no attention in both the American and Japanese markets.<br>Mercari joined the scene around the same time as LetGo and OfferUp, eccomerce apps that allow users to buy and sell things within their city.<br>These apps supressed Mercari's growth until its rebranding in late 2019.<br>Mercari overhauled their app and began to viciously market their platform just months before the CoronaVirus outbreak.<br>Once the United States went into lockdown, American's began to go through their belongings and sell what they no longer needed. This in turn boosted Mercari's marketplace tenfold, and made it one of the top eccomerce sites in the world. </p>

  <h3>Selling on Mercari</h3>

  <h4>Pros</h4>
  <ul>

      <li><b>No Listing Fees</b>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Much like Poshmark, Mercari charges their sellers <strong>zero</strong> listing fees whenever they post an item.
              <br>
              This allows sellers to post as much as they want in order to increase their sales and ultimately bring more buyers to their page.
            </li>
          </ul>
      </li>
      
      <li><b>Promote Listings</b>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Mercari has an option to "promote" your listing to the top of the results page if you drop the price by 5%.
              <br>
              This allows sellers to get more views for their listings and essentially sell the items that have been listed for a long time. 
            </li>
            <li>
              Everytime you make a sale, Mercari will boost the rest of your items as what some would consider a "reward".
              <br>
              This is an incentive for sellers to list more items and potentially make more money.
            </li>
          </ul>
      </li>

      <li><b>Shipping</b>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Mercari offers buyers and sellers (depending on who pays) two different flat fees for shipping and provides a shipping label. Any item that weighs a pound or less costs <strong>$4.99</strong>to ship and anything more than a pound costs <strong>$9.99</strong> to ship. This makes it easy for sellers to implement the shipping cost into their listings and still offer free shipping to their buyers.
            </li>
          </ul>
      </li>

      <li><b>Mercari App</b>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The Mercari app is the easiest eccomerce app to navigate when it comes to creating listings.
              <br>
              Sellers are able to take photos of their item from the app and create their listing in under five minutes.
              <br>
              The app is also aesthetically pleasing with very vibrant colors and recognizable icons.
            </li>
          </ul>
      </li>

  </ul>


  <h4>Cons</h4>
  <ul>

      <li><b>Speed of Growth</b>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Mercari is growing at such a fast rate that sellers are worried that policy changes are in the near future.
              <br>
              A month ago Mercari implemented a 2.3% processing fee that angered sellers across the site.
              <br>
              The displeasure comes from the idea that many Mercari sellers migrated from Ebay because of their greedy fees and they do not want to see their new platform follow in the same tracks.
            </li>
          </ul>
      </li>

      <li><b>Rating System</b>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Mercari's rating system is considered the worst amongst all of the selling platforms.
              <br>
              Once an item has been delivered, the buyer looks over the item and decides whether they are satisifed with it or not.
              <br>
              If the buyer is satisfied with their purchase, then they rate the seller from <strong>one to five stars</strong>. The buyer must submit their rating before the seller is able to, and the seller is unable to see it.
              <br>
              Sellers rely on their ratings to mke sales and to have a certain level of credability.
              <br>
              Sellers believe that the rating system gives buyers too much power in making a rating and often gives them positives ratings when they were in fact difficult to work with.
