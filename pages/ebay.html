  <h3>Selling On Ebay </h3>

  <h4>Pros</h4>
  <ul>

      <li><b>Global Audience</b>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Ebay is a great place to market your items to a global audience! There are currently 182 million users on Ebay with over 1.3 billion items listed yearly!
            </li>
          </ul>
      </li>
      
      <li><b>Range of Items</b>
          <ul>
            <li>
              You can sell (just about) anything on Ebay.
            </li>
            <li>
              From kid's toys to automobiles, if you are willing to sell it then there is a place for it on Ebay.
            </li>
          </ul>
      </li>

      <li><b>Ease of Access</b>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The Ebay App makes listing items unbelievably easy. It's as simple as writing an introduction, description, and adding a few pictures to start making money!
            </li>
          </ul>
      </li>

      <li><b>Payment</b>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Ebay utilizes PayPal as a platform to both purchase items and get paid for them. Once you have been paid for your item, transferring your money is only a few clicks away.
            </li>
          </ul>
      </li>

  </ul>

  <h4>Cons</h4>
  <ul>
      <li><b>Selling Fees</b>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Selling fees on Ebay are the second highest amongst all of the eccomerce sites. The average item sold on Ebay requires a $0.35 listing fee as well as a 12% fee of the final selling price.
            </li>
            <li>
              Items over $1,000 are have considerably lower final value fees (2%) but much higher listing fees, upwards of $35. Even if an item does not sell, you will still be charged a listing fee.
            </li>
          </ul>
      </li>

      <li><b>Competition</b>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Because Ebay is a global based selling platform, there is a tremendous amount of competition.
            </li>
            <li>
              More competition means that there is a possibility that your listing may be buried beneath a sea of listings.
            </li>
          </ul>
      </li>

      <li><b>Shipping</b>
          <ul>
            <li>
              If you plan on selling through Ebay be prepared to offer free shipping. Buyers on Ebay expect free shipping on every item or they will highly unlikely to purchase it.
            </li>
            <li>
              I recommend incorporating the shipping price into the listing price in order to save yourself some money.
            </li>
          </ul>
      </li>

      <li><b>Power of the Buyers</b>
          <ul>
            <li>
              When it comes to disputing a return, Ebay representatives will almost always take the buyers side.
            </li>
            <li>
              Ebay will do whatever it takes to keep their customers coming back to buy more, this can include deciding a item return decision in their favor when they may have acted outside of the guidelines.
            </li>
          </ul>
      </li>
  </ul>
