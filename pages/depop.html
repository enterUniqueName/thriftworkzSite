  <h2>What is Depop? </h2>

  <p>Depop is a social shopping app that marries the posting facet of Instagram with the selling aspects of Poshmark.<br>Depop was founded in 2011 and allows sellers to post pictures of their trendy clothes for sale in a timeline format that is similar to Instagram.<br>Depop has over 15 million users with the mass majority of them being under the age of 25. </p>

  <h3>Selling on Depop</h3>

  <h4>Pros</h4>
  <ul>

      <li><b>Listing Fees</b>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Much like Mercari, Depop charges their sellers <strong>zero</strong> listing fees whenever they post an item.
              <br>
              This allows sellers to post as much as they want in order to increase their sales and ultimately bring more buyers to their page.
            </li>

            <li>
              Depop does have a 10% comission fee that is applied to all sales.
            </li>
          </ul>
      </li>
        
      <li><b>Easy to Find Clothing</b>
          <ul>
              <li>
                Finding great deals on clothing is easy to find on Depop if you are a buyer.
                <br>
                Depop has a tremendous search engine that allows users to search by brand,size,color,and by hashtag.
              </li>
          </ul>
      </li>

      <li><b>Ease of Access</b>
          <ul>
            <li>
              If you are familiar with using Instagram, then you will have no issue navigating Depop.
              <br>
              Because Depop modeled their platform after the most popular app in history, this has helped boost their number of users throughout time.
            </li>
          </ul>
      </li>

  </ul>


  <h4>Cons</h4>
  <ul>

      <li><b>Too many Dropshippers</b>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Depop has entirely too many dropshippers that congest the clothing feeds with stock images of cheap clothing.
              <br>
              This tends to bury the posts of real clothing and tarnishes the Depop brand of being a trendy clothing selling app.
            </li>
          </ul>
      </li>

      <li><b>Replica Clothing</b>
          <ul>
            <li>
              With the over abundance of dropshippers comes the posting of replica clothing and accessories.
              <br>
              Depop is flooded with fake jackets,coats,handbags,backpacks,and jewlry.
              <br>
              This causes caution within buyers and affects how they interact with sellers who have genuine merchandise to sell.
            </li>
          </ul>
      </li>

      <li><b>Shipping</b>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Shipping on Depop is a <strong>NIGHTMARE</strong>.
              <br>
              Depop has <strong>zero</strong> regulations when it comes shipping and it causes strife among both the buyers and sellers.
              <br>
              Depop offers their own flat rate shipping up to one pound in weight but it is very expensive at $9.99.
              <br>
              Depop sellers are encouraged to ship on their own and update the tracking number whenever the item is sent.
              <br>
              Because there is no true guidelines for shipping, sellers can ship items whenever they want and it cause animosity between the selling community and the buyers community.
              <br>
              There have also been reports that sellers will accept payment from a buyer and then never ship the item.
              <br>
              These types of incidents tend to draw people away from an ecommerce site.
